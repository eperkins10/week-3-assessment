The internet is basically a large network of computers that communicate via servers.  
It honestly still somewhat confuses me because I didn't really grow up as the "techy kid"
or however you want to call the more technically inclined children.  Computers are all on networks,
and they all talk to eachother using servers and routers.  There are different ways different 
networks and computers communicate to eachother I believe.  The layout of the servers is different
and the amount of routers used is based off of how many computers there are on the network.

When you click on a link,  your computer figures out what you've clicked,  and then uses the DNS to 
find the ip address of the website that you clicked via the link.  It's basically a communication pattern
between the client (your computer) and the server in which the ip address/domain of the website that you clicked 
on is.
